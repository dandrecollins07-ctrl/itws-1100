Lab 03 — Personal Website (ITWS-1100)
What this lab is

For Lab 03, I built and organized my personal ITWS website inside the iit/ directory and deployed it to my personal server. This site is my main hub for ITWS labs and future projects.

Site structure (how it’s organized)

I organized the site so it’s easy to navigate and easy to maintain as I add more labs:

iit/index.html
My homepage / personal “brand” landing page.

iit/labs/index.html
A labs hub page that lists my labs and links to each solution/landing page (starting with the resume).

iit/lab02/index.html
My Lab 2 resume page (semantic HTML + CSS).

iit/assets/css/site.css
Shared site styling for my homepage and labs page (kept in subfolders to follow the lab rules).

iit/lab03/
This folder contains my Lab 03 documentation (this README) and my IA materials.

Design choices (why I did it this way)

I kept the styling simple and consistent across pages so the site looks clean and professional. I used the same “resume-style” layout approach (clear headings, spacing, and readable structure) to make the labs page easy to scan.

I avoided inline styles and kept resources like CSS in subfolders to match the assignment requirements.

Testing + Deployment

Tested locally by opening the HTML files in the browser.

Deployed to my personal web server and verified the site loads at:

URL: http://collid7rpi.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/iit/iit/





Notes

Password protection from Lab 1 was removed to ensure the site is accessible for grading.

I will continue adding new lab landing pages and project links as the semester goes on.
