      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <hr>

      <p class="subtext">
        I am a dual major in Computer Science and Information Technology & Web Science at
        Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. My academic interests focus on
        <strong>systems engineering</strong> and <strong>data analytics</strong>,
        with an emphasis on building reliable, well-structured technical systems.
      </p>

      <p class="subtext">
        Mathematics is one of my favorite subjects due to its emphasis on intense
        problem solving and structured thinking. I enjoy working through challenging
        problems that require persistence and multiple approaches.

      <h2>Goals & Academic Interests</h2>
      <hr>

      <ul>
        <li>Develop strong fundamentals in systems design and data-driven decision making</li>
        <li>Apply computing concepts to real-world infrastructure and analytics problems</li>
        <li>Build technical solutions that balance performance, clarity, and usability</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="subtext">
        To better understand how people interact with technology, I’ve taken coursework
        in <strong>cognitive science</strong>, which has shaped how I think about usability,
        human behavior, and decision-making in technical systems.

      <h2>Outside the Classroom</h2>
      <hr>

      <p class="subtext">
        Outside of academics, I spend a lot of time staying active. I regularly go to the gym
        and enjoy playing basketball as a way to relieve stress.
      </p>

      <p class="subtext">
        I’m also a longtime Minecraft player — one of the first experiences
        that sparked my interest in systems, automation, and creative problem solving.
